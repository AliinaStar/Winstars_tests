## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python 3.x installed. You can install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that your data is organized in the `data/` directory as shown in the project structure.
2. **Training**: Run the training script to train the model.
    ```bash
    python src/train.py
    ```
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using the evaluation script.
    ```bash
    python src/evaluate.py
    ```

## Results
The results of the model evaluation will be saved in the `results/` directory. You can analyze the performance metrics and visualizations to understand how well the model is performing.
